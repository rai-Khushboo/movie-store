# 🎬 Disney+ Hotstar Clone – React + Firebase

This project is a fully functional and visually accurate **Disney+ Hotstar clone** built using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase**. The goal of this project was to replicate a modern, real-world OTT platform interface while integrating core functionalities such as authentication, data fetching, routing, and responsive design. Rather than relying on third-party APIs, all movie/show data is **self-created and stored in Firebase Firestore**, providing full control over the data structure and integration.

The clone aims to simulate the core user experience of Disney+ Hotstar, including browsing through categorized movie carousels, viewing detailed movie descriptions, user login/signup, and accessing protected routes. The user interface is responsive and clean, built using Tailwind CSS to ensure mobile and desktop compatibility with minimal effort.

## 🌟 Project Objectives

- To replicate a popular, complex user interface using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**
- To build a full-stack web experience using **Firebase Firestore** and **Firebase Authentication**
- To demonstrate how real-world streaming platforms organize and serve content dynamically
- To practice building protected routes and managing authenticated user sessions
- To showcase modern web development skills in a creative and portfolio-worthy way

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔐 Firebase Authentication  
- Secure **user login/signup** system built with Firebase Auth  
- Users are redirected based on login state using **protected routes**  
- Conditional rendering for navigation and content access

### 🗃️ Firebase Firestore Integration  
- All movie and show data is **stored manually in Firestore**  
- Data is structured by categories (e.g., Recommended, Trending, Originals)  
- Fetched asynchronously using `useEffect` and displayed using sliders and grids

### 🧩 Modular Component Design  
- The UI is broken down into reusable React components such as `Header`, `MovieCard`, `Slider`, `DetailsPage`, and `ProtectedRoute`  
- State management handled using React Hooks

### 🧭 React Router  
- Clean navigation between **Home**, **Login**, and **Details** pages  
- Dynamic routing for displaying individual movie/show details

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS Styling  
- Sleek and modern interface using Tailwind utility classes  
- Fast styling without writing custom CSS  
- Fully responsive layout for different screen sizes

### 📱 Responsive UX  
- Optimized for both mobile and desktop users  
- Uses **flex/grid layouts** for consistent content flow  
- Navigation and carousels adjust seamlessly on smaller devices

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to build an **OTT-like UI/UX** using React and Tailwind
- Structuring and retrieving data from **Firebase Firestore**
- Implementing **authentication and route protection** in React
- Handling **asynchronous data fetching** with loading states
- Building modular, scalable UI components
- Using **conditional rendering** and state logic for user interaction

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

This project goes beyond basic CRUD operations or to-do apps. It reflects real-world thinking:
- You’re working with **your own dataset**, stored in a real database
- It mimics how **streaming platforms structure and display content**
- You're dealing with **authentication, protected routes, UI/UX, responsiveness**, and more
- The project can be expanded into a full product by integrating video playback, watchlists, or user preferences

It showcases **both front-end design sense and backend understanding**, making it ideal for portfolios, interviews, and academic presentations.

## 🧩 Future Ideas

- Add a **Watchlist** feature for logged-in users  
- Integrate **video players** with trailers or embedded content  
- Include **search and filter** functionality across genres  
- Add **pagination or infinite scrolling** for large datasets  
- Implement **dark/light mode** or theme customization
